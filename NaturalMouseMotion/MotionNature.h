 * mouse movement step, making it easy to implement this as a formula based on the input parameters.
 * e.g the something like 'deviation = totalDistanceInPixels / completionFraction', resulting in smooth movement.
 * (Don't actually use this formula), 'Noise' is generating an offset from the original trajectory and is accumulating.
 * As deviation should be deterministic and return same result for same parameters, it should not include Random
 * behaviour, thus Random is not included as a parameter.
 * It is recommended that deviation is decreasing when completionFraction nears 1, but MouseMotion itself
 * also makes sure that the effect of deviation is reduced when the mouse is nearing its destination.

 * target and initial position. This is not the final deviation of the mouse as MouseMotion will randomly decide

 * or is flipped negatively.
